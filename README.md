# Mimaco-Minga-of-Myths-Against-the-Oblivlion 

The main objective of this augmented reality game
is to rescue the traditions of Colombia through a
musical journey around the 6 geographical regions
of the country. The experience begins with a minga*
formed by local mythological characters, who
share their concern for the lack of knowledge of the
children about the ancestral culture. These characters
are committed to recovering that traditions
with the player's collaboration. Each mission takes
place in a representative place of each region,
where a musical challenge with typical instruments
and songs of the area must be solved. As the
challenge progresses, the player acquires bonuses
related to gastronomy that enhance their skills in
the game.



If the challenge is overcome, the player wins a
physical badge associated with an animal of the
region. This prize unlocks hidden content in AR of
the region that you recovered from oblivion.
